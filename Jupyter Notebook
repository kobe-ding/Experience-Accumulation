1. About IMPORT modules:

If certain packages(modules) have been installed in anaconda but cannot be imported smoothly in Jupyter, check:

import sys
sys.executable

in both python.exe and Jupyter Notebook. The two paths should be the same.

To change the corresponding path of Jupyter Notebook, go to \\jupyter\kernels\..
